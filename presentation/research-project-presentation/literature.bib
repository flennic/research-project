    abstract = "We present a deep neural architecture that parses sentences into three semantic dependency graph formalisms. By using efficient, nearly arc-factored inference and a bidirectional-LSTM composed with a multi-layer perceptron, our base system is able to significantly improve the state of the art for semantic dependency parsing, without using hand-engineered features or syntax. We then explore two multitask learning approaches{---}one that shares parameters across formalisms, and one that uses higher-order structures to predict the graphs jointly. We find that both approaches improve performance across formalisms on average, achieving a new state of the art. Our code is open-source and available at \url{https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/NeurboParser}.",

Our empirical results show that only gold-standard syntactic information leads to consistent improvements in semantic parsing accuracy, and that the magnitude of these improvements varies with the specific combination of the syntactic and the semantic representation used. In contrast, automatically predicted syntax does not seem to help semantic parsing. Our error analysis suggests that there is a significant overlap between syntactic and semantic representations.",

   abstract = {The use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks continues to yield better results in natural language processing tasks. One area which recently has seen significant improvements is semantic dependency parsing, where the current state-of-the-art model uses a multilayer LSTM combined with an attention-based scoring function to predict the dependencies. In this thesis the state of the art model is first replicated and then extended to include features based on syntactical trees, which was found to be useful in a similar model. In addition, the effect of part-of-speech tags is studied. The replicated model achieves a labeled F1 score of 93.6 on the in-domain data and 89.2 on the out-of-domain data on the DM dataset, which shows that the model is indeed replicable. Using multiple features extracted from syntactic gold standard trees of the DELPH-IN Derivation Tree (DT) type increased the labeled scores to 97.1 and 94.1 respectively, while the use of predicted trees of the Stanford Basic (SB) type did not improve the results at all. The usefulness of part-of-speech tags was found to be diminished in the presence of other features. },
